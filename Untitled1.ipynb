incorporating interactive tools and video simulations, but struggles to create fully immersive learning experiences.Traditional onboarding methods often result in low retention and disconnection for new employees in hybrid or remote work environments.Virtual reality in onboarding creates immersive environments where new hires can engage with real-life scenarios, enhancing retention through experiential learning.Virtual reality aligns with different learning styles by incorporating visual, auditory, and interactive elements simultaneously in well-designed simulations.Perception plays a key role in immersive learning in virtual reality, allowing learners to evaluate, interpret, and connect information in meaningful ways.Companies like Walmart, Accenture, and healthcare firms are already using VR for training on customer service, company culture, emergency protocols, and equipment handling.Challenges in VR implementation include cost, design expertise, accessibility, and motion sensitivity, but advancements in hardware and software are addressing these barriers.Curiosity is essential for effective VR learning as it drives exploration, questioning, and deeper engagement in immersive environments.The future of experiential VR onboarding is seen as a transformative tool in employee training, enhancing retention, shortening onboarding time, and improving overall learning experiences.Virtual reality in corporate training represents a new era of employee onboarding, revolutionizing the way organizations approach training and integrating technology, psychology, and human behavior.Immersivelearning | 11 Apr, 2025FlexM Taps Ho Chee Wai as Singapore Country HeadFlexM has appointed Ho Chee Wai as the Country Head for Singapore.Ho brings over 20 years

arise regarding data privacy, regulation, explainability, and human involvement in decision-making.Google Cloud's Aashima Gupta and Cognizant's Ramaswamy Rajagopal discuss AI in healthcare, emphasizing the need for self-regulation and best practices.Ensuring enterprise-grade privacy security is crucial for building trust in AI applications touching patients and clinical diagnostics.AI solutions in healthcare must prioritize explainability, transparency, and trust, backed by accurate and diverse datasets for model training.Organizations need to proactively adapt AI strategies to comply with evolving regulations and maintain patient safety.Balancing AI efficiency with strict privacy laws like HIPAA in healthcare requires adherence to legal requirements to avoid unintended consequences.Human involvement remains essential in healthcare decision-making, and AI should complement, not replace, human compassion and empathy.Anticipating future regulations and integrating change management strategies are key for AI-driven decisions to align with legal and ethical standards.Continuous evaluation of AI models for compliance and transparent data usage through industry standards like a 'constant color model card' are imperative.In healthcare, AI should incorporate empathetic elements alongside scientific decisions, recognizing the importance of human compassion in patient care.Siliconangle | 19 Mar, 2025How Adobe’s Real-Time CDP is Revolutionizing Personalized Customer ExperiencesAdobe’s Real-Time CDP revolutionizes personalized customer experiences.The
